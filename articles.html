          <h3>How to avoid designing BORING layouts</h3>
          <p>
            Many UI/UX designers create uninspired marketing landing pages by
            simply arranging cards. To stand out, one should focus on unique and
            creative designs. The post demonstrates a reimagined layout for a
            pet rental service using MidJourney for asset generation and tools
            like RVE to create scroll-based animations. Designers are encouraged
            to show visuals of people interacting with pets instead of text,
            emphasizing unique approaches in portfolios. Today, tools like
            Webflow and Framer allow designers to implement interactive
            animations without extensive coding knowledge.

          <h3>Semantic HTML5 Elements </h3>
          <p>Semantic HTML elements are those that clearly describe their meaning in a human- and machine-readable way.
           Elements such as <header>, <footer> and <article> are all considered semantic because they accurately describe the purpose of the element and the type of content that is inside them.</p>

          <p>A well-performing website not only improves user experience but also impacts accessibility, search engine rankings, conversion rates, and more. Maintaining optimal performance requires continuously monitoring your site to catch performance regressions.</p>
